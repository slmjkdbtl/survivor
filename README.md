# Folder structure

- `src` - source code for your kaboom project
- `www` - distribution folder, contains your index.html, built js bundle and static assets
- `src-tauri` - tauri project folder, contains tauri config file, icons, rust source if you need native code

## Development

```sh
$ npm run dev
```

will start a dev server at http://localhost:8000

## Distribution

```sh
$ npm run build
```

will build your js files into `www/main.js`

```sh
$ npm run bundle
```

## Desktop

This project uses tauri for desktop builds, you have to have `rust` installed on your system for desktop to work, check out [tauri setup guide](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites/)

For tauri native APIs look [here](https://tauri.app/v1/api/js/)
